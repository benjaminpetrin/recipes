Rhubarb and Sweet Potato Lentil Stew with Cilantro oil

Ingredients

 * 1 cup red lentils
 * 2 Tbsp ghee or coconut oil
 * 1 Tbsp mustard seeds
 * 1 Tbsp ground cumin
 * 1 tsp turmeric
 * 5 cardamom pods
 * 1 star anise
 * 1 tsp cayenne (or to your taste)
 * 1 ½ cups diced onions
 * 2 Tbsp tamari
 * 5 cloves garlic, minced
 * 3 Tbsp fresh ginger, minced
 * 1 large sweet potato, cut into bite-size pieces
 * 7 stalks rhubarb, cut into bite-size pieces
 * 5 cups water
 * 1 to 2 Tbsp honey
 * Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
 * Steamed brown rice, quinoa, millet, or toasted whole-grain pita, for serving

Cilantro oil Ingredients
 * 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
 * ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
 * 1 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
 * 1 tsp honey
 * Pinch sea salt

Directions

1. Wash lentils well by covering them with water in a large bowl and swishing around until the water is murky. Drain and repeat until water is clear (usually 3 to 4 times). Set aside.
2. Melt the ghee or coconut oil in a large pot on the stove. Add the dried spices and stir constantly, ensuring that they do not burn. When the spices smell fragrant, add onions and tamari and cook for about 5 minutes until the onions have softened. Add the garlic and ginger. If the mixture is too dry, add a little water to prevent burning.
3. Add remaining ingredients, cover and simmer until lentils are cooked, about 30 minutes. Stir in the honey and season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Serve over steamed brown rice, quinoa, millet, or with whole-grain pitas. Drizzle with Cilantro Oil (below).
5. Add all the cilantro oil ingredients to a blender or food processor and blend in high until the sauce is relatively smooth. Season to taste. Serve over stew. Store leftovers in the fridge.
