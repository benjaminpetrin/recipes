squash etc ingredients:
 * 1 large spaghetti squash, cut in half lengthwise + seeds scooped out
 * 4-5 kale stalks (7-8 if you’re using lacinato), stems removed
 * 1 shallot, peeled
 * 1/2 cup chopped toasted nuts of your preference (I used cashews)
 * 3 tbsp sesame seeds (toasted, raw, whatevs)
 * chopped leafy herb if you feel it (cilantro, mint, thai basil etc)
 * 1 bunch of broccoli, cut into florets
 * salt + pepper

lime peanut sauce ingredients:
 * 1/2 inch fresh ginger, peeled + rough chopped
 * 2 cloves of garlic, peeled + rough chopped
 * 1-2 tsp sriracha (or other hot sauce you like)
 * 2 tbsp peanut butter (or tahini, sunflower seed butter, almond butter etc)
 * 1 lime, peeled + chopped
 * 1 tbsp rice vinegar (or apple cider/white wine vinegar)
 * 2 tsp agave (or honey etc)
 * 1.5 tbsp tamari soy sauce
 * little scoop of extra virgin coconut oil (optional, but I love the coconut fragrance here)
 * tiny splash of toasted sesame oil
 * 1/2 cup grapeseed oil

Directions
 # Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
 # Line a baking sheet with parchment and place the squash halves, cut side down, onto the sheet. Bake for about an hour or until the flesh pulls away in easy strands.
 # While the squash is baking, slice the kale leaves into 1/3 inch-ish ribbons and place in a large bowl. Cut the shallot in half lengthwise, slice the halves into thin half-moons and set aside. Chop up the herbs and toasted nuts as well, set them aside with the shallows.
 # Once you’ve cut the broccoli, set a medium saucepan with about an inch of water over medium heat. Bring it to a simmer. Place the broccoli florets into a steamer basket and set aside until right before service.
 # Place all of the sauce ingredients in a blender and bend until fully incorporated. Taste for seasoning and set aside.
 # When squash is cool enough to handle, place the steamer basket of broccoli into the pot with the simmering water. Put a lid on it and allow broccoli to steam for 3-4 minutes, or desired doneness. While broccoli is steaming, scrape the spaghetti strands out with a fork into the large bowl with the sliced kale. The heat from the squash should wilt the kale slightly. Pour a big splash of the dressing into the bowl, season with salt and pepper and lightly toss the squash and kale.
 # Remove broccoli from the heat. Portion the squash and kale into 4 bowls. Top each bowl with the steamed broccoli, sliced shallots, chopped nuts, sesame seeds, chopped herbs and extra sauce.
