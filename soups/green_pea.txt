Ingredients:
 * 3 tablespoons fresh ginger, well chopped
 * 10 sm-med cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
 * 2 serrano chiles, stemmed and chopped
 * 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, plus more to serve
 * 3 tablespoons ghee or sunflower oil
 * 2 bay leaves
 * 1 medium onion, chopped
 * 4 1/2 cups good-tasting vegetable stock or water
 * 3 1/2 cups / 500 g / 18 oz shelled fresh or frozen peas
 * 1 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste
 * a squeeze of fresh lemon juice
 * 8 fresh mint leaves, slivered
 * pan-fried paneed, queso fresco, paneer, or haloumi, cut into tiny cubes - optional

Directions
 # Use a food processor or hand blender {in a deep bowl) to puree the ginger, garlic, chiles, cumin and three tablespoons of water into a paste. You could also use a mortar and pestle. Set aside.

 # Place a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add the ghee. 
 # When hot, add the bay leaves and saute for 30 seconds. 
 # Stir in the onion and cook for a few minutes, until it begins to take on a bit of color. At this point, stir in the garlic-ginger paste, and cook for another minute. 
 # Carefully add the stock, stir well, and bring to a boil. Then add the peas. Simmer just until the peas are bright, and cooked through - just a couple minutes.

 # Remove from heat, fish out the bay leaves, add the salt, and puree well with a hand blender. 
 # Taste, and add more salt if needed. 

Serve hot topped with a bit of lemon juice, a pinch of cumin, mint leaves, and pan-fried paneer or cheese.
