 1. Rinse the split peas and lentils until they no longer put off murky water. Place them in an extra-large soup pot, cover with the water, and bring to a boil.
 2. Reduce heat to a simmer and add the carrot and 1/4 of the ginger. Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the split peas are soft.
 3. In the meantime, in a small dry skillet or saucepan over low heat, toast the curry powder until it is quite fragrant. Be careful not to burn. Set aside.
 4. Place the butter in a pan over medium heat, add half of the green onions, the remaining ginger, and raisins.
 5. Saute for two minutes stirring constantly, then add the tomato paste and saute for another minute or two more.
 6. Add the toasted curry powder to the tomato paste mixture, mix well, and then add this to the simmering soup along with the coconut milk and salt.
 7. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes or so. The texture should thicken up.
 8. Serve with cilantro green onion over rice
