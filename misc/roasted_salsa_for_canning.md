# Roasted Salsa for Canning

## Ingredients

 - 3 lb. plum tomatoes, cored
 - 3/4 lb. jalapeño peppers
 - 4 garlic cloves
 - 1 medium-size white onion, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices
 - 2 tsp. salt
 - 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
 - 1/3 cup fresh lime juice (about 4 limes) 
 - 4 Ball® Pint (16 oz) Fresh Preserving Jars with lids and bands
 
 ## Directions
 
  1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Arrange first 4 ingredients on a large rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Bake at 425°F  for 20 minutes. Remove garlic from baking sheet. Bake 20 more minutes or until vegetables are very soft and beginning to char.
  2. Transfer jalapeño peppers to a bowl; cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let stand 15 minutes.
  3. Meanwhile, remove skins from tomatoes, and coarsely chop. Coarsely chop onion. Place tomato, onion, garlic, and salt in a medium stainless steel or enameled saucepan.
  4. Peel peppers; remove and discard seeds, if desired. Finely chop peppers; add to tomato mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat, and simmer 2 minutes. Stir in cilantro and lime juice.
  5. Ladle hot salsa into a hot jar, leaving 1⁄2-inch headspace. Remove air bubbles. Wipe jar rim. Center lid on jar. Apply band, and adjust to fingertip-tight. Place jar in boiling- water canner. Repeat until all jars are filled.
  6. Process jars 20 minutes, adjusting for altitude. Turn off heat; remove lid and let jars stand 5 minutes. Remove jars and cool. 
  
  ## Notes
   - Not certain if core is this context means de-seeding or simply removing the top. I think I did half/half and like the result, but given the yield was lower it probably is supposed to not be de-seeded. I think I will continue this as I did.
   - Should double or quad for use throughout year
