Produces two pizzas with finished dough weight = 327.95 g

## Directions
 - Dissolve sugar in warmed water at 100f.
 - If using active dry yeast, rehydrate in the water and allow to double (do this in the final mixing bowl)
 - In a seperate bowl, mix flour and salt (also yeast if instant)
 - With a dough hook at speed 1, bring together water and flour by slowly adding flour to water, scraping down with spatula occasionally.
 - After flour hydrates and a ball comes together, add oil and process until oil is incorporated
 - Process at speed 1-2 until doughball smooths out.
 - Divide and kneed by hand to shape, move to oilled container and ensure dough is covered in oil
 - Cover with plastic wrap (I allow it to touch the surface to avoid drying out)
 - Let rest for one hour or more to double, gently punch down and replace plastic wrap
 - Move to fridge until ~3 hours before cooking
 - 3 hours before cooking (adjusting for temperature), allow dough to come up to room temp.
 - At room temperature, stretch dough into lightly oiled pan, allow to rise in pan for an hour
 - Deflate any large bubbles and top and cook at 475-500. 
 - Inspect bottom of pizza and finish on stovetop, moving constantly, if needed.
