# Fermented Hot Sauce notes

## Notes

 - I shoot for a "true" 3% brine, so 3% of the total mass of peppers + water as salt.
 - I use water that has been filtered through charcoal overnight to avoid chlorine that may prohibit bacteriological growth
 - Empiracally, a 16oz container filled with water to below threads (to allow headspace) is 400g water. Fill a 16oz with 400g of water and observe or mark height.
 - At 400g of total mass, 12g of salt will be needed.
 - Fermentation proceeded most rapidly in containers where peppers were processed in food processor to a fine dice (1-1.5cm pieces).
 - I add a small amount of white vinegar to tip the pH towards the desired state for Lactobacillus.
 - I sprinkle a small amount of additional salt to the top of prepared containers as a "safety" against measurement errors, and as an additional precaution against mold growth on the surface during the time that oxygen is still present in the headspace.
 - For an airlock, I drill a hole in a lid and insert a gromet appropriate for a 2-part beer brewing airlock.
 - I have not found it necessary to ensure peppers are absolutley below surface, as such I do not use a weight.
 - Since the airlock will prevent spoilage, it makes sense to only process jars as you depleat your supply. Jars are likely stable for a year according to others. The airlock will still need to be monitored to ensure the airlock fluid does not evaporate.
 - Some suggest using half brine and half vinegar during the final prepartion to ensure shelf safety after the airlock has been removed.
 
 # Ingredients
  - 1 or more pounds of hot peppers, such as jalapenos (I prefer at least half to be ripened to red)
  - Pickling salt
  - White vinegar
  - Rice or another vinegar (later)
  - Cleaned 16oz jars, modified to accept airlocks.
  - Airlocks
 
## Directions - preperation for fermentation
 - Pick and rinse peppers gently. Remove stem and seeds from peppers and cut out any problematic areas
 - Process peppers in batches to a fine dice, intermixing peppers from different plants to acocunt for differences in heat
 - Add 12g of salt to cleaned 16oz containers, add a scant tablespoon of white venegar. Swirl to dissolve. If additional water is needed to dissolve, add the least amount of (filtered) water as possible until the salt is dissolved.
 - Pack containers with peppers to marked line (see above notes).
 - Top off with  water to bring containers up to 400g
 - Sprinkle the surface with an additional 1/4tsp of salt
 - Install airlock, filled with vodka and place out of direct light. Monitor fermentation. Peppers can likely be processed as soon as airlock activity ceases over the course of a day (or remove to darker area for longer term storage). 

## Directions - finishing
 - Remove airlock and inspect peppers
 - Seperate peppers from brine using a fine strainer.
 - Empty peppers into blender and blend, adding half brine, half vinegar until the desired consistency is reached.
 - Store final sauce at room temp, take care when opening as fermentation remains active. 
 
 ## Additional things to vary
 - I used rice vinegar for the final processing. Good but might try other things.
