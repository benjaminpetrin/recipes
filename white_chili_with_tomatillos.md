White Chili with Tomatillos and Roasted Mushrooms
===========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 3 15 oz cans of white beans, I used 2 cannellini + 1 great northern
 * 1 large white onion, diced
 * 2 shallots, diced
 * 2 tablespoons cumin
 * 2 "Not-chick'n" bouillon cubes
 * 1/2 cup white wine
 * 1 large yellow bell peppers, diced
 * 6-8 tomatillos, peeled and washed
 * 20 oz white button mushrooms, diced
 * 1 jalapeno pepper, stem removed
 * 1 serrano pepper, stem removed
 * 2 tablespoons chickpea flour
 * olive oil
 * salt and pepper
 
Directions
-----------
 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Toss mushrooms with a tablespoon of olive oil and roast for 15 minutes. Set aside.
 2. In a large pot saut√© onion and shallot with olive oil, cumin and bouillon cubes. 
 3. Once the onion is translucent, add the peppers and deglaze the pan with the white wine. Cook until most of the wine has evaporated.
 4. Pulse tomatillos and hot peppers in the food processor until finely chopped. Add mixture to the pot along with the beans and mushrooms. Add enough water to cover and simmer for one hour.
 5. Whisk chickpea flour with some of the broth and add it all back to the pot. Cook for another 10 minutes. (This will thicken the chili.)
 6. Add salt and pepper to taste.
