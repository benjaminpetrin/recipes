Balinese Tempeh Satay Bowl 
==============

Ingredients
------------

* 1 1/2 cups brown rice (preferably soaked overnight, rinsed and drained)
* 1 medium head broccoli

Tempeh in Sweet and Sour Sauce
------------
* Knob coconut oil
* 1 package (~200 gr) tempeh, small slices
* 1/2 red onion, diced
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1" piece ginger, minced
* 1 red chili, minced
* 1/4 tsp. turmeric (optional - I like the color it gives)
* 3 Tbsp. tamari
* 2 Tbsp. rice wine vinegar
* Juice 1/2 lime
* 1 tsp. honey

Directions
------------

1. Cook rice.
1. Chop broccoli florets and stem into bite side pieces. When rice has 5 minutes remaining, add broccoli to pot, recover with lid and let everything finish cooking together.
1. Heat coconut oil in medium saut√© pan over medium-high heat. Once oil is hot add onion, garlic, ginger, chili, and turmeric. Cook until beginning to soften (1-2 minutes).
1. Add tempeh to pan in one layer, making sure all pieces are laying flat in the pan. Let cook for a few minutes, until tempeh begins to get some color. Flip tempeh pieces and cook for another couple of minutes.
1. In the meantime make the sauce. Whisk together remaining ingredients in a small bowl.
1. Once tempeh begins to brown on the second side, turn heat down to low and add sauce to the pan. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape any brown bits off the bottom of the pan.
1. Once sauce has thickened and reduced slightly remove pan from heat.
