Ingredients
 * 4 cup s diced butternut squash
 * Olive oil
 * Salt
 * 1 large onion, diced
 * 2 leeks, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced
 * 4 cloves garlic, minced
 * 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
 * 1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes
 * 2 cups paella or arborio rice
 * 1/2 cup white wine
 * One 15-ounce can diced tomatoes
 * 1 quart vegetable stock
 * 2 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves or green scallions to garnish

Directions
 #  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
 #  Combine the squash, 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Toss to combine and arrange in an even layer. Bake in the oven until browned and caramelized, about 30 to 40 minutes. Set aside.
 #  Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large cast iron skillet or paella pan over a medium-high flame. Add the onion and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. 
 # Toss in the leeks and continue to cook until wilted, about 3 more minutes. 
 # Add the garlic, paprika, chili flakes, and rice. Stir to coat in the oil and onion mixture. 
 # Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until all the rice has gotten a chance to toast on the bottom of the pan, about 3 minutes. 
 # Add the wine and scrape up any brown bit on the bottom of the pan. Stir in the tomatoes and 1 teaspoon salt. Spread the rice mixture in an even layer in the pan.
 # Pour enough of the stock over the rice so it is just slightly submerged. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 25 to 30 minutes. Taste the rice; it should be crusty around the edges and al dente on top, but cooked through in the middle. If not, add another cup of stock and continue to cook for another 5 to 10 minutes.
 # When paella is done, arrange the roasted butternut squash on top and garnish with parsley or scallions.
