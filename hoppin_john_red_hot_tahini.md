For the Hoppin’ John:
 * 1 1/2 cup dried black eyed peas, soaked in water overnight
 * 1 tablespoon liquid smoke
 * 3 bay leaves
 * 1 teaspoon salt

For the Red Hot Tahini:
 * 1/2 cup tahini
 * 1/3 cup Louisiana Hot Sauce (like Frank’s Red Hot)
 * 1/4 cup water (plus more as needed)
 * 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
 * 1 clove garlic

For the Tomato Parsley Salad:
 * 2 cups diced tomatoes
 * 1/3 cup finely chopped parsley
 * 1 cup finely sliced green onion
 * 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
 * Several dashes fresh black pepper
 * Dash salt

Also:
 * 1 pound steamed greens (I used turnip greens)
 * 3-4 cups cooked rice for serving (I used black rice)
 
Directions
 1. Make the Hoppin’ John: Drain the soaked beans, and place them in a 4 quart pot. Submerge in water, with water coming about 2 inches above the beans. Add bay leaves, salt and liquid smoke. Cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, bring the heat down low, and let simmer for about 20 minutes. Check often so that they don’t overcook. When beans are still firm, turn the heat off and uncover. Let them hang out until everything else is ready. They will continue to cook in the hot water, so turning the heat off ensures that they don’t overcook.
 2. Make the Red Hot Tahini: Simply blend everything up in a little blender until smooth. A Magic Bullet works perfectly. Add water by the tablespoon to thin as needed. Taste for salt and spiciness.
 3. Make the Tomato Parsley Salad: Toss all ingredients together in a medium mixing bowl. Taste for pepper and vinegar.
 4. Assemble: Place greens and rice side by side in a large bowl. Top with black-eyed peas. Drizzle with sauce and top with the tomato salad. Serve immediately and prosper!
