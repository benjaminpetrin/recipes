Spicy squash salad with lentils and goat cheese
=========

Ingredients
---------
 * 3/4 cup black or green lentils
 * 6 cups peeled, seeded and cubed butternut squash or sugar pumpkin (1-inch cubes) (from about a 2-poudn squash)
 * 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
 * 1 teaspoon ground cumin
 * 1 teaspoon hot smoked Spanish paprika
 * 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt
 * 1 cup soft crumbled goat cheese
 * 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, plus additional to taste
 * Roasted seeds (about 1/2 cup) from your butternut squash (optional)

Directions
---------
 1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Toss squash or pumpkin cubes with 2 tablespoons oil, cumin, paprika and salt. Arrange in a single layer on baking sheet and roast 20 minutes. Flip pieces and roast for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until tender. Cool.
 2. Meanwhile, soak lentils for 10 minutes in a small bowl, then drain. Cook lentils in boiling salted water until tender but firm, about 30 minutes. Rinse with cold water, then drain and cool.
 3. Combine lentils, pumpkin, any oil you can scrape from the baking sheet with vinegar and 1 tablespoon oil. Season with salt and pepper and extra vinegar, if desired. Divide among plates and pass with goat cheese to sprinkle.
