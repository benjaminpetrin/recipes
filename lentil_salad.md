Ingredients:
    2¼ cups (1 lb.) Du Puy lentils
    1 medium red onion, diced
    1 cup dried currants (you could also use raisins or other dried fruit)
    1/3 cup capers

Vinaigrette:
    1/3 cup cold pressed, extra virgin olive oil
    1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
    1 Tbsp. maple syrup
    1 Tbsp. strong mustard
    2 tsp. salt
    2 tsp. pepper
    1 tsp. ground cumin
    1/2 tsp. turmeric
    1/2 tsp. ground coriander
    ½ tsp ground cardamom
    1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
    ¼ tsp. ground cloves
    1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg
    ¼ tsp. ground cinnamon

Optional add-ins: (we did arugala, goat cheese, cilantro, and red pepper)
    Arugula
    Goat cheese
    Fresh herbs: flat-leaf parsley, cilantro, basil
    Sprouts
    Crispy seasonal veggies
    Walnuts

Directions
    # Cook lentils till al dente, rinse with cool water to staop cooking (don't over cool)
    # Finely dice red onion – the salad is best if all the ingredients are about
      the same size. If using raisins, chop them roughly to make them a bit
      smaller, and do the same with the capers if they are large. 
    # Shake vinaigrette together
    # Combine
