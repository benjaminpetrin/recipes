Porcini crusted tofu with shallot gravy
=========

Ingredients
-----------
* 14 oz extra firm tofu, pressed

Forthe marinade
-----------
* 3 tablespoons tamari (or soy sauce)
* 1 1/4 cups veggie broth
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
* 1 tablespoon olive oil

For The Crust
-----------
* 1 oz dried porcini mushrooms
* 1/4 cup fine bread crumbs
* Pinch each tarragon, rosemary, thyme crushed with your fingers
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* Several dashes fresh black pepper
* 1 clove garlic, finely minced

For the Shallot Gravy
-----------
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 cups shallot, thinly sliced
* 1/4 cup leftover porcini/breadcrumb mixture
* 1 3/4 cups vegetable broth
* 1/4 cup of the tofu marinade

Directions
-----------
 1. Slice the tofu into 8 even slices widthwise. Slice each of those diagonally corner to corner so that you have long triangles.
 2. Mix together marinade ingredients in a large bowl and marinate the tofu for at least an hour and up to 8 hours, turning when you can.
 3. When tofu is ready, prepare the crusting mixture. In a blender, pulse the porcinis until theyâ€™re powdery. Now toss them in a wide bowl along with the breadcrumbs, herbs, salt, pepper and garlic. Reserve 1/4 cup of the mixture to use in the sauce.
 4. Prepare sauce: Preheat a saucepan over medium heat and cook the shallots in oil until browned, about 8 minutes. Add the breadcrumb mixture and toss to coat. Now add the vegetable broth and marinade. Let cook until nicely thickened, 10 minutes or so. Taste for salt and pepper. Keep covered and warm until ready to serve.
 5. Now cook the tofu: Preheat a large, heavy bottomed pan over medium high heat. In the meantime, dredge half the tofu slices in the breadcrumb mixture and place on a plate. Pour a thin layer of oil in the pan and cook the dredged tofu slices on each side for about 4 minutes each, until golden brown. Use a thin metal spatula (as thin as possible) so that you can easily get under the tofu to flip it. A thick spatula might cause the breading to fall off. While the first batch is cooking, dredge the second batch. Keep cooked tofu warm by placing on a plate and covering with tin foil.

Serve over mashed potatoes smothered in gravy. Scatter a few roasted beets. Place a few slices of tofu on top and garnish with extra scallions (from the mashed potatoes) or whatever fresh herbs you can on hand.
