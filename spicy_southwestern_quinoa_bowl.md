 Directions
 =========
 1. In a bowl, combine all the Mango Slaw ingredients and toss well. Massage the slaw with your hands for 1-2 minutes. Cover and keep in the fridge until ready to serve.
 1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
 1. Add the tomatillos to the baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes or until the tomatillos are charred. Add the tomatillos and the remaining ingredients to a blender. Blend until completely smooth. Taste and add salt as needed. *NOTE: I like to roast the tomatillos and sweet potatoes at the same time.
 1. Cook the quinoa according to package directions. Fluff with a fork and toss with the zest + juice of 1 lime and chopped cilantro. Keep warm.
 1. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
 1. Place the sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Add the taco seasoning and gently toss with your hands or two spatulas to evenly coat. Bake for 15-20 minutes, then flip and bake for 10 minutes more or until the sweet potatoes are tender.
 1. Toss the black beans with salt, pepper and a handful of chopped cilantro.
 1. To assemble the bowls, divide the quinoa among bowls. Top with the sweet potatoes, black beans and sliced avocado. Add the mango slaw and drizzle the bowl the with the tomatillo vinaigrette. Sprinkle with queso fresco and serve
