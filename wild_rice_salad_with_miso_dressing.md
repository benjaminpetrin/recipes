Wild Rice Salad With Miso Dressing
========

Ingredients
--------
 * 1/2 cup wild rice (any rice works, timing will vary accordingly)
 * 14 oz. block extra firm tofu
 * 2 tsp. coconut oil
 * 2 tsp. soy sauce or tamari
 * fresh ground pepper
 * 1 heaping cup thinly sliced carrots
 * 3/4 cup cooked, shelled, organic edamame
 * 3 Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds

Miso Dressing
--------
 * 2 Tbsp. white miso
 * 2 Tbsp. agave nectar or brown rice syrup
 * 1 Tbsp. sesame oil
 * 2 1/2 Tbsp. rice vinegar
 * 1 shallot, minced
 * Juice of half an Orange
 
Directions
-------- 
 1. Drain and pat dry tofy. Cut it into a 1/2 inch dice. Heat the coconut oil over medium high heat. Add the tofu and saute for about five minutes. Sprinkle the soy sauce and a few grinds of fresh pepper over the top and saute another few minutes until the edges are browned. Turn off heat and set aside.
 1. Whisk all of the dressing ingredients together (Don't be tempted to add salt, miso is pretty salty).
 1. In a large bowl, combine the rice, tofu, sliced carrots, edamame. Toss everything with the dressing. Add the sesame seeds and cilantro and give it another toss. Serve room temperature or chilled.
