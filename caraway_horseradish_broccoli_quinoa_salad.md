Caraway and Horseradish Broccoli Quinoa Salad
=========

caraway + horseradish dressing ingredients
-------
* 2 tbsp grated fresh horseradish
* juice of 1/2 a lemon (about 2-3 tbsp)
* 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
* salt + pepper
* 1/2 tsp caraway seeds (+ extra for the salad)
* 2 tsp dijon mustard
* 1 tbsp maple syrup
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp flaxseed oil (or more olive oil)

salad ingredients
-------
* 1 shallot, sliced thin
* 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
* salt + pepper
* 1 tsp maple syrup
* 1/4 cup quinoa, rinsed
* 1-2 stalks of broccoli, cut into small florets
* 1 small head of cauliflower, cut into small florets
* 1 apple, small dice
* 3 tbsp chopped fresh dill
* 1/4 cup marcona almonds, chopped

Directions
-------
 1. In a blender, combine all of the dressing ingredients until you have a smooth, creamy mixture. Check it for seasoning, adjust, and set aside.
 2. Place the sliced shallots in a small bowl. Cover them with the 1/3 cup of apple cider vinegar. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the maple syrup. Let the mixture sit while you make the rest of the salad. You want the slices of shallot to be lightly softened.
 3. In a small saucepan, combine the quinoa with 1/2 cup of filtered water and a pinch of salt. Bring the quinoa to a boil over medium heat. Then lower to a simmer until all of the water is absorbed, about 12 minutes. Set aside to cool.
 4. Steam or boil the broccoli and cauliflower florets for 3-4 minutes or until slightly soft. Drain the florets and transfer to a larger serving bowl. To the bowl, add the cooked quinoa, diced apple, chopped dill, marcona almonds, and extra caraway seeds.
 5. Drain the shallots and add them to the bowl as well. Add as much dressing as you like and a good amount of salt and pepper. Toss to combine.
