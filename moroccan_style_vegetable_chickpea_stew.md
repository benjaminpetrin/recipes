moroccan-style vegetable + chickpea stew
==========

Ingredients
----------
* big knob of coconut oil
* 1 medium onion, small dice
* 2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp ground coriander
* chili flakes (optional)
* 1-2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 3-4 dates, pitted + chopped
* 2 carrots, chopped (1/2 inch pieces)
* 1 large or 2 small sweet potatoes, peeled + chopped (1/2 inch pieces)
* 1 28-ounce can fire-roasted tomatoes
* 3 cups vegetable stock (or more, depending)
* 1 yellow pepper, stemmed and chopped (1/2 inch pieces)
* 2 cups (or a 14-15 ounce can) cooked chickpeas
* salt + pepper
* couple handfuls of chopped greens

to serve:
----------
* cooked brown rice/quinoa/millet/couscous
* chopped flat leaf parsley/cilantro
* fine grated lemon zest
* extra virgin olive oil

Directions
----------

1. Heat the coconut oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the onions and lower heat until they are sizzling.
2. Once the onions are a bit soft and translucent, add the cinnamon, cumin, coriander and chili flakes. Slowly sauté and stir this mix until the onions are really, really soft, about 5 minutes. 
3. Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chopped dates, carrots and sweet potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir to coat the vegetables in the spices and oil. Add the tomatoes and stir. Add the vegetable stock. Bring the soup to a boil and simmer until the sweet potatoes are just tender, about 10-12 minutes.
4. Add the chopped yellow peppers and chickpeas and stir the soup. Season the whole thing again with salt and pepper. Simmer until the yellow peppers are tender and the sweet potatoes are quite soft, about 5 minutes. 
5. Add the greens to the pot (and more stock if necessary) and cook for 1 minute, or until just-wilted.
6. Check the soup for seasoning and serve it hot with cooked grains, drizzles of olive oil, lemon zest and chopped herbs.
