For the dressing:
 * 1/2 cup natural peanut butter
 * 1/2 cup water
 * 1/4 teaspoon salt
 * 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
 * 1 tablespoon chopped ginger
 * 1 tablespoon sriracha (less if you’re a spice wuss)
 * 1 tablespoon agave
 * 1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce

For the salad:
 * 1 1/2 lbs zucchini
 * 1 lb cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced in half
 * 1/2 lb cucumber, sliced into half moons (about 1 1/2 cups)
 * 1/2 cup finely diced red onion
 * 1/2 cup roasted, salted peanuts
 * 1 cup fresh herbs, such as: Thai basil, mint, cilantro (or a mix of all three), chopped

Directions:
 1. Make the dressing: Place all ingredients in a small blender and blend until smooth. That’s it! Keep sealed and refrigerated until ready to use.
 2. Make the salad: Slice the zucchini lengthwise, on a mandolin or by hand, into 1/8 inch thick slices. Stack those slices and cut them lenghtwise into long noodley strips. (Or see note above about ribbon noodles.)
 3. Toss the noodles with the dressing, reserving some of the dressing for drizzling. Taste for salt.
 4. Top servings with tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and peanuts. Drizzle with extra dressing as desired. Finish with fresh herbs and serve!
