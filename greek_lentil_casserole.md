Ingredients:
 * 1 cup brown lentils, picked over and rinsed if needed (lentils that come in a package often don't need to be rinsed)
 * 1 large onion, chopped small
 * 2 tsp. minced garlic (or more)
 * 1 cup + 2 T vegetable stock or broth (canned vegetable broth is fine here)
 * 1 bay leaf
 * 1/2 tsp. fresh ground black pepper
 * 1/2 tsp. Greek oregano
 * 1 tsp. Greek Seasoning (You can make your own Greek Seasoning if you don't have any, or just use the spices in that mix that you do have.  I like Greektown  Billygoat Seasoning from The Spice House.)
 * 1 can (14.5 oz.) stewed tomatoes, drained and slightly mashed
 * 1 green bell pepper, seeds removed and finely chopped
 * 1 red bell pepper, seeds removed and finely chopped
 * 3/4 cup crumbled Feta cheese - See more at: http://www.kalynskitchen.com/2013/02/vegetarian-greek-lentil-casserole.html#sthash.o7Dr3SdT.dpuf

Directions
 * Preheat oven to 375F/190C.  Use a 3 quart casserole dish with a tight-fitting lid.  Combine lentils, chopped onion, minced garlic, vegetable broth, bay leaf, black pepper, Greek oregano, and Greek seasoning in the casserole dish and bake covered for 45 minutes.
 * While lentils bake, drain the tomatoes and mash gently inside the can with a fork.  Cut seeds out of the bell peppers and finely chop, and crumble enough Feta to make 3/4 cup.
 * After 45 minutes, take lentils out of the oven, stir in the crushed tomatoes, put the lid back on and bake for 15 minutes more.  Then take out again, gently mix in the finely chopped bell pepper and 2/3 of the Feta.  Crumble the rest of the Feta over the top and bake 15-20 minutes more, or until the Feta is starting to melt and get lightly browned.  Serve hot.
