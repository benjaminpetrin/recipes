Grilled Halloumi Skewers with Cilantro-Tahini Sauce
==============

For the halloumi
----------
* 1 7 or 8 oz package halloumi,
* ½ tablespoon olive oil
* ¼ teaspoon black pepper

For the vegetables
----------
* 1 small red onion
* 1 green or red pepper
* 1 to 1½ dozen cherry tomatoes
* 1 small zucchini
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* ⅛ teaspoon sea salt, optional*

For the sauce
----------
* ½ cup lightly packed cilantro
* 3 tablespoons tahini (or substitute with some Harisa paste for a different taste, also very good)
* 1 tablespoon tamari
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* ⅛ teaspoon black pepper
* 2 teaspoons honey
* water, for thinning

For the topping
----------
* Extra cilantro
* Sesame Seeds

Directions
-----------
1. Place 8 wooden skewers in water and let soak for at least an hour.
2. Remove halloumi from package and drain of any excess water. Cut halloumi into ideally 24 cubes (I started with 12 cubes and cut each in half). Lightly toss with ½ tablespoon olive oil and black pepper, set aside.
3. Cut vegetables into pieces roughly the same size at the halloumi. Place in a bowl and toss with olive oil, smoked paprika, and garlic powder. Let mixture sit while lighting the grill.
4. Once grill is hot and ready, thread a mixture of vegetables and halloumi onto the skewers. The mixture is messing, so wearing gloves is suggested (unless you're like me and don't mind.) Be careful with the halloumi as it can break easily. I found the best way to thread it onto the skewer is slowly and gently.
5. Preheat grill to medium-low (if applicable.)
6. Place skewers on clean grill grate and cook, rotating occasionally, until cheese and vegetables are charred. Remove from heat and let slightly cool.
7. In a food processor or blender, combine ingredients for tahini sauce, pureeing until cilantro is minced. Thin with water to reach desired consistency and drizzle over skewers. Finish with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro and sesame seeds.
