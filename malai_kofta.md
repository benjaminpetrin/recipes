Malai kofta
===========

Kofta Ingredients
-----------
 * 1 carrot
 * 1/8 cauliflower
 * 6 ounces paneer cheese
 * 2 tablespoons besan (chickpea flour)
 * 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
 * 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
 * Salt
 * 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
 * Oil, for deep-frying
 
Directions
-----------
 1. Very finely shred the carrot, cauliflower and cheese. Combine with the besan, cumin seeds, coriander, salt to taste and baking powder in a bowl. 
 2. Mix well, mashing together by hand. Divide into golfbar or smaller sized portions (Mix in however much chickpea flour is need for balls to hold firm).
 3. Add 1 1/2 inches of oil to a saucepan and heat to 350 degrees. Add the balls and deep-fry until browned. Set aside on paper towels to drain.

Sauce
----------
 * 1 large onion, cut in pieces
 * 2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic
 * 1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped ginger root
 * Water
 * 1/4 cup oil
 * 3/4 teaspoon cumin seeds
 * 1 teaspoon finely chopped serrano chile (I used a dried thai chilli)
 * 2 1/2 large tomatoes
 * 1 teaspoon salt
 * Scant teaspoon pure red chile powder
 * 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
 * 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
 * 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
 * 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
 * 30 golden raisins
 * 20 cashews
 * 1 teaspoon dried methi (fenugreek) leaves

Directions
-----------
 * Combine onion, garlic and ginger in a blender; blend until pureed, adding about 2 tablespoons water to make blending possible.
 * Heat a skillet over high heat. Add the oil. When the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and fry a few seconds. Add the blended onion mixture and the serrano chile and fry well, stirring, until the mixture thickens and dries out but is not browned, about 10 minutes.
 * Puree the tomatoes in the blender and add to the skillet. Rinse out the blender with 1/3 cup water and add to the skillet. Cook 10 minutes.
 * Add the salt, chile powder, coriander, garam masala and turmeric. Let this cook at a boil until it deepens in color and the oil rises to the surface, about 10 minutes. Add the cream and 1/3 cup water. Add the raisins and cashews. Rub the methi leaves between the palms of your hands to crush, then add to the skillet. Taste for seasoning. Cook another 5 minutes. Add the Kofta; simmer 5 minutes. Thin with water or more cream, if needed.
  
Notes
 * Raisins and cashews doubled above
 * Spice liberally
