Roasted Cauliflower Street Tacos
=========

Ingredients
---------
 * 1 small or 2/3 large head cauliflower (use the scraps after making cauli steaks!)
 * 2 T olive oil
 * 1/2 tsp chili powder
 * 1/4 tsp sea salt
 * 1/4 tsp cumin
 * 1/4 tsp paprika
 * 1/4 tsp dried Mexican oregano, crushed in the palm of your hands
 * few grinds black pepper

 * 1/2 red onion, diced
 * juice of 1 lime
 * 1/4 cup 0% Greek yogurt (vegan variation: give cashew cream a shot!)
 * 1 – 3 tsp hot sauce, such as Cholula (to taste)
 * 6 taco-sized corn tortillas (check the ingredients if you’re truly avoiding gluten)
 * mango salsa (homemade)
 * diced jalapenos, cilantro and extra limes, for serving
 
 Instructions
 ----------
 1. Preheat oven to 425F. Cut cauliflower into small florets and toss with olive oil, chili powder, sea salt, cumin, paprika, crushed oregano and black pepper until evenly coated. Arrange on a baking sheet and bake 45 mins, tossing every 15 mins, until deep golden brown in spots and slightly crispy.
 1. Meanwhile, mix onion with lime juice and set aside to mellow. Combine Greek yogurt and hot sauce, to taste. (If you want a more drizzle-able sauce, thin with a tablespoon or two of water.)
 1. Before serving, warm tortillas on a hot, ungreased grill or skillet. Serve tortillas piled with roasted cauliflower, marinated onions, yogurt mixture, salsa, cilantro, jalapeños and wedges of lime for spritzing. Enjoy!
