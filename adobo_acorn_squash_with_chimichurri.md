Directions
------------
1. Preheat oven to 375˚. Peel the acorn squash, cut in half, and remove seeds. Take each half and slice each half into ½" slices. Place in a bowl with yogurt. In a separate bowl, combine spices, sucanat, salt, and pepper. Add into bowl with squash and toss mixture until squash is coated. Place squash in a single layer on a covered baking tray and roast until tender, 25-30 minutes.
2. While squash is roasting, heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add quinoa and stir until liquid has evaporated and quinoa is lightly browning and crisp, 2-4 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside.
3. To make chimichurri, combine all ingredients, except water, in a blender and pulse. Add 1-2 tablespoon of water at a time until sauce is the consistency you desire.
4. Serve squash with quinoa and a few spoonfuls of chimichurri and cheese (if desired)
