Spanish chickpeas with roasted red peppes and capers
=========

Ingredients
----------
 * 3 large red peppers
 * 4 cups of cooked chickpeas, rinsed if canned (about 2 19-ounce cans)
 * 1/4 cup of mint, chopped
 * 3 tablespoons of capers, rinsed
 * 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, red wine or sherry vinegar (I used red wine vinegar)
 * 1/4 teaspoon of salt
 * 2 cloves of garlic, minced
 * 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, divided

Directions
----------
 1. Preheat the oven broiler. Line a small roasting pan with aluminum foil. Place the pepper halves in the pan, cut side down, and place in the oven on the shelf closest to the broiler.
 2. Broil until the pepper skins are completely black, about 8-15 minutes. Remove from the oven, wrap the pepper in the foil and allow to stand for 10 minutes. Remove the foil and rub off the skins of the peppers. Set peppers aside.
 3. In a large frypan, heat 1 tbsp oil.  Add the chickpeas and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until they are all golden brown (this takes about 10 minutes). Set aside to cool.
 4. Cut the peppers into half-inch wide strips and put them in a large bowl together with the pan-fried chickpeas, herbs and the capers.
 5. In a smaller bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, salt, garlic and oil. Pour over the chickpea mixture and combine.
 6. Serve immediately, or refrigerate it for a day to get the flavors to mingle fantastically.
