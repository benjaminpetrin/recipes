Instructions
---------
 1. Preheat oven to 350°F, and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
 1. Toss the sweet potatoes, apple, and tomatoes onto the baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast 30 to 35 minutes until the edges of the sweet potato are golden brown, tossing halfway through.
 1. Meanwhile wrap the ear of corn in foil and place it in oven during the last 15 minutes of roasting time.
 1. In a small bowl whisk together the olive oil, chipotle paste (or powder), apple cider vinegar, honey (or maple syrup), and a pinch of salt and pepper.
 1. Place the baby spinach and/or arugula in a large bowl along with the roasted sweet potatoes, apples and tomatoes. Slice the kernels off the corn and add them to the bowl as well. Toss the salad with the dressing, toasted pepitas, and feta cheese, if using. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
