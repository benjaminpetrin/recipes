Ingredients

 2 Tbsp olive oil
 1/2 lb portabella mushrooms, stemmed, chopped in 1/2 inch pieces
 1 medium onion, chopped
 3 large cloves garlic, chopped
 1 can diced tomtatoes (juices included)
 2 Tbsp dry red wine
 2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsely
 1 tsp. dried thyme
 1/4 tsp. dried rosemary
 1 bay leaf
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
 1 (15 ounce) can navy, great northern, or cannellini beans

Heat a large non-stick skillet or casserole over medium heat, and saut√© the
mushrooms and onions. When mushrooms begin to exude their juices and onions are
cooked (5 minute), add the garlic and continue to cook, stirring, for another
minute. Do not allow the garlic to brown. Add tomatoes, spices, wine, and bay
leaf.  Stir and bring to a boil, cover and simmer over low heat for 15 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Remove and discard the bay leaf.

Mix in the beans, and simmer over low to medium heat until beans are warmed
through, about 5 minutes. Add water, if necessary, to keep ingredients moist.
Adjust seasonings and serve.

Serve with crusty bread
