===========

Butternut Squash
-----------
 * 2 cups 1/4" cubed butternut squash
 * 1/2 cup diced red onion
 * 1 tablespoon olive oil
 * 1-2 teaspoon crushed dried chipotle peppers (see note)
 * 1/4 teaspoon salt

Beans
-----------
 * 3/4 cup black beans, with liquid
 * 1 tablespoon lime juice
 * 2 teaspoons honey
 * 1/2 teaspoon cumin
 * 2 tablespoons minced cilantro

Everything Else
-----------
 * 4 to 6, 6" corn tortillas
 * 2-3 ounces crumbled goat cheese
 * Cilantro, for topping

Instructions
-----------
 1. Preheat oven to 425Ëš.
 1. Toss butternut squash with onion, olive oil, chipotle pepper, and salt. Spread in a single layer on a sheet tray covered with parchment paper. Roast for 20-25 minutes or until squash is tender and beginning to brown.
 1. In a small sauce pan, combine black beans with liquid, lime juice, honey, and cumin. Cook over medium-low until the liquid has mostly evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes (may take less or more time depending on how much liquid there was). Remove from heat and stir in the cilantro.
 1. Place the tortillas on a sheet tray and divide black bean mixture evenly. Top with butternut squash and finish with a sprinkle of goat cheese. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes until tortilla is crisp and goat cheese is browning. Serve with a sprinkle of cilantro.
