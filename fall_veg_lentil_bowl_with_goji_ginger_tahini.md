* salt and pepper
* 2 cups romanesco florets
* 6 small carrots, scrubbed + cut in half
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* fat pinch of za’atar spice
* 1 leek, dark green part removed + hairy end trimmed
* 1 small beet, peeled + sliced paper thin
* 1 small apple, cored + sliced paper thin

goji ginger tahini cream ingredients
-----------
* 1/4 cup dried goji berries
* 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
* juice of half a lemon
* salt + pepper
* 1 tbsp tahini
* 1 inch fresh ginger, peeled + rough dice
* 1 tsp maple syrup
* 2-3 tbsp olive oil
* 2-3 tablespoons water

Directions
-----------
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the lentils to the water and simmer until just tender, about 25-30 minutes. Drain the lentils and then scrape them into a bowl. Drizzle them with a bit of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss to mix and set aside.
3. Place romanesco florets, carrots, the tablespoon of olive oil, za’atar, salt + pepper on the lined baking sheet. Toss it all to coat and slide into the oven. Roast until you start to see brown edges on the romanesco, about 15 minutes. Slice the leek down the middle lengthwise and then slice the halves into half moons. Remove the tray of veg from the oven and carefully toss the leeks in the mix. Slide the tray back into the oven for 5 more minutes.
4. While the veg is cooking, make the goji cream. Place the goji berries in a medium bowl and cover them with boiling water. Let them sit a couple minutes to soften. Then, drain the gojis and toss them into a blender. To this, add the apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, salt + pepper, tahini, ginger, maple syrup, olive oil, and filtered water. Blend until you have a creamy mixture. Taste it and see if you need more sweetness, acidity or salt. Adjust and set aside.
5. Divide the lentils and roasted vegetables between two bowls. Place the thin slices of beet and apple on top. Cut the avocado into wedges or dices and place on top of both bowls. Drizzle the bowls with the goji ginger cream, and garnish with some toasted sesame seeds and parsley leaves. I like an extra wedge of lemon on the side of mine too.
