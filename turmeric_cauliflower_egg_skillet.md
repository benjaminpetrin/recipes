Turmeric Cauliflower Egg Skillet
============

Ingredients
-----------
 * 4 teaspoons coconut oil, divided
 * 1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion
 * 2 cups cauliflower florets
 * Squeeze of lime juice
 * 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
 * 1 teaspoon fresh minced ginger
 * 1/4 teaspoon salt
 * Pinch cayenne pepper
 * 2 eggs
 * Lime juice, for serving
 * Cilantro, for serving

Apple Chutney
-----------
 * 1 tablespoon olive oil
 * 1/4 cup diced red onions
 * 1 teaspoon minced ginger
 * 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
 * 1/4 cup pitted and chopped Medjool dates
 * 2 cups peeled and cubed apples, roughly 2 large apples
 * 1/4 teaspoon salt
 * 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder
 * Zest from 1 lemon
 * 1/4 cup water
 * 1/8 teaspoon red chili flakes (optional

Directions
-----------
 1. To make chutney: In a medium pot, heat olive oil for apple chutney. Add in onions and ginger, cooking until fragrant, 3-4 minutes. Add in vinegar and give a good stir to loosen up an stuck onions. Add in the remaining ingredients and reduce heat to medium low. Let chutney cook until apples and dates have broken down into a chunky sauce, 15-20 minutes (depending on stove-top heat.) Add more water if chutney is too thick. Remove from heat and let sit until ready to serve.
 1. Over medium low heat, melt 2 teaspoon coconut oil in an 8 to 10 inch skillet. Add in the onions, followed by the cauliflower. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions and cauliflower are slightly brown and tender, about 5 to 7 minutes.
 1. Squeeze in the lime juice and scrape up any stuck pieces. Add in the turmeric, ginger, and cayenne (if desired). Cook for 1 minute more, just to warm the ginger. Melt in the final 2 teaspoons of coconut oil in the skillet then create a well in the center.
 1. Crack the eggs in the center, reduce the heat to low and cover the skillet with a lid. Cook until the egg whites are set and the egg yolks are at your desired firmness, 8 or so minutes for over-easy eggs, longer for more firm yolks.
 1. Serve with extra lime juice, minced cilantro, and apple chutney
