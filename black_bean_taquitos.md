Baked Black Bean Taquitos
==========

Ingredients
----------
 * ½ cup black beans, drained and rinsed if using canned
 * ½ cup sweet corn kernels
 * 1/4 cup diced red pepper
 * 1/4 cup diced onion
 * ½ teaspoon garlic powder
 * ¼ teaspoon cumin
 * 1/4 teaspoon paprika
 * 1/4 teaspoon chili powder
 * 2 tablespoons minced cilantro
 * ⅓ cup shredded cheese, like colby jack
 * 10 to 12 6” corn tortillas
 * Olive oil, for brushing
 * Queso Fresco, for topping

Instructions
----------
 1. Preheat oven to 400˚.
 1. In a food processor, combine black beans, sweet corn, pepper, onion, spices, cilantro, and cheese. Pulse three to four times until ingredients are slightly combined-this is just to chop slightly.
 1. Heat tortillas until pliable (good instructions here). Scoop 2 to 3 tablespoon of the filling onto the 1/3 of the tortilla closest to you. Roll the edge closest to you over the filling and tuck tightly. Continue to roll and place the taquito seam side down on a baking tray. Stick with a toothpick if necessary. Repeat with remaining filling.
 1. Brush with olive oil and bake for 18 to 22 minutes until tortillas are browning and crisp. Remove, top with cilantro and queso fresco, and serve.

Note: often doubled
