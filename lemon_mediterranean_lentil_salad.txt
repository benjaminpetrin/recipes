Ingredients:
 * 1 tbsp olive oil, divided
 * 1 cup green lentils, rinsed (I used French du Puy)
 * 3-4 tbsp lemon juice (from 1 lemon), divided
 * 1 clove garlic, grated or minced
 * 1 tsp dried basil
 * 1 cup vegetable broth
 * 1 cup water
 * 1.5 tsp fresh thyme
 * 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved if large (~2 cups)
 * 1 tbsp capers, rinsed
 * 3 tbsp olives (I used black olives)
 * 1 tsp lemon zest (from 1.5 lemons)
 * 1 tsp maple syrup or agave, to taste (optional, I did not use)
 * 1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted

Directions:
 # In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, combine half the oil and lentils. Saute the lentils for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. 
 # Add 3 tbsp of lemon juice, garlic, basil, broth and water. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to medium-low, covering the pot and cook for 30 minutes, until tender.
 # Drain when the lentils are tender and add in the lemon juice after draining it].
 # Turn off the heat and stir in the thyme, tomatoes, capers, olives, lemon zest and maple syrup (if using). Cover and let sit for 4-5 minutes, then stir again and taste, adding additional lemon juice if needed. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Sprinkle with pine nuts prior to serving.

Serves 4.
