===========

Ingredients
-----------
 * 2 Tbsp (30 ml) coconut oil
 * 3 cloves garlic, minced (1 1/2 Tbsp or 9 g)
 * 1 tsp minced ginger
 * 1/2 cup (64 g) diced carrots
 * 3 Tbsp (60 g) red curry paste
 * 1 6-ounce (170 g) can tomato paste (Reduce to 1 big Tbsp)
 * 2 cups (480 ml) low sodium vegetable broth
 * 1 cup (240 ml) water
 * 2/3 cup (128 g) dry red lentils, thoroughly rinsed in cold water + drained
 * 1-2 Tbsp (12-24 g) coconut sugar (or maple syrup, I ommit alltogether)
 * 1/2 tsp ground turmeric, plus more to taste
 * optional: 1/3 cup (80 ml) light coconut milk

For serving
-----------
 * Cooked brown rice
 * Pita or naan
 * Pickled red onion
 * Fresh chopped cilantro

Instructions
-----------
 1. Quick pickle some red onions and set aside
 1. Thoroughly rinse lentils in a fine mesh strainer and set aside. If serving with brown rice, cook at this time using this method from Saveur.
 1. Heat a large rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add coconut oil, garlic, ginger, and carrots. Sauté for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
 1. Add curry paste and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
 1. Add tomato paste, vegetable broth, water and stir to combine. Then add lentils, coconut sugar, turmeric, and stir.
 1. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat slightly to low (or medium-low), and gently simmer for 20 minutes, or until lentils are tender. Stir frequently to incorporate flavors, and add more vegetable broth as needed if the mixture becomes too thick.
 1. An optional (but recommended) step: stir in coconut milk for additional creaminess, and to balance the heat of the curry paste.
 1. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more turmeric for depth of flavor, coconut sugar for sweetness/flavor balance, or a pinch of salt for saltiness.
 1. To serve, divide brown rice (optional) and lentils between 2-3 serving bowls and garnish with cilantro, pickled onions, and pita or naan for dipping (optional).
