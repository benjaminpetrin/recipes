Ingredients

    * 2 tablespoons cooking oil
    * 1 large onion, thinly sliced
    * 4 cloves garlic, minced

    * 1 teaspoon ground cumin
    * 1 teaspoon ground coriander
    * 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
    * 1/2 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder

		(or substitute all of the above with 3 tsp garam masala)

    * 4 tomatoes, pureed
    * 1/2 pound paneer, cubed
    * 1/4 cup water
    * 1 teaspoon white sugar
    * salt to taste
    * 1/4 cup cream
    * 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions

	# Start some rice
	# Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
	# Cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onions are soft and golden brown, about 5 minutes. 
	# Sprinkle the cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder over the onion and garlic; continue cooking until the seasonings are fragrant, about 30 seconds.
	# Pour the pureed tomatoes into the skillet; cook until the excess liquid evaporates and the oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes. 
	# Add the paneer, water, sugar, and salt to the mixture; stir gently so the paneer does not break apart. Cook until the paneer begins to absorb some of the liquid, about 10 minutes. 
	# Stir the cream into the mixture and simmer another 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.

Notes:
	I substituted all of the spices for 3 tsp of garam masala and it goes together very quickly
	Use 1 cup of tomatoe puree in place of pureed tomatoes
	This recipe is fantastic and very simple
    Adding pease is good
	Use all of the oil
