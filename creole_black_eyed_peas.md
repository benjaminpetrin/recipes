Creole black eyed peas
==========

Ingredients
----------
 * 1 large onion, chopped
 * 1 green bell pepper, chopped
 * 1 rib celery, chopped
 * 3 cloves garlic, minced
 * 2 cups dried black-eyed peas, picked over and rinsed
 * 5 cups water
 * 15 ounce can diced tomatoes
 * 1 teaspoon dried oregano
 * 1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
 * 1/8 teaspoon cayenne (or more to taste)
 * 1 tablespoon hot sauce (or to taste)
 * 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
 * 1/2 teaspoon Liquid Smoke flavoring

Directions
----------
 1. Spray the bottom of a large pressure cooker with a light film of oil. Over high heat, sauté the onion until it begins to brown; add the bell pepper, celery, and garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the black-eyed peas and water, seal the cooker, and bring to high pressure. Cook at high pressure for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow pressure to come down naturally.
 2. Once the pressure is down, open the cooker and add all remaining ingredients except Liquid Smoke. Cook for 15-30 minutes, until peas are completely soft and thickened. Add the Liquid Smoke and cook for another 5 minutes. Serve hot over rice with more hot sauce on the table.
 3. To make without a pressure cooker, soak the peas overnight in cold water.  Drain. Follow the directions for sautéing the vegetables. Then add all ingredients except liquid smoke to the pot, along with enough additional water to cover the peas by one inch. Cook until peas are completely tender, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, adding more water as necessary. When they’re tender, add the Liquid Smoke, cook for 5 more minutes, and serve over rice.

Serve with extra Tobascco
